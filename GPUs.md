## Explain to me the components of GPU with respect to LLM size. For ex whats the role RAM and VRAM. how they differ etc. Use first simple examples with analogies may be followed actual LLM size like no of parameter etc.


A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.
Now, let's talk about the components of a GPU. The main components are the cores, VRAM (Video Random Access Memory), and RAM (Random Access Memory).

* Cores: These are the processing units of the GPU. They are responsible for performing computations and processing data. The number of cores in a GPU can greatly influence its performance.
* VRAM: This is the memory that the GPU uses to store data that it needs to access quickly. It's like the GPU's own personal storage space. The size of the VRAM can greatly influence the GPU's performance. The larger the VRAM, the more data the GPU can store for quick access, which can improve performance.
* RAM: This is the memory that the computer uses to store data that it needs to access quickly. The GPU can access data stored in the RAM, but it's slower than accessing data stored in the VRAM. The size of the RAM can also influence the GPU's performance, but it's not as important as the size of the VRAM.

Now, let's use an analogy to make this easier to understand. Think of the GPU as a chef in a restaurant. The cores are the chef's hands, which he uses to prepare the food. The VRAM is the chef's personal storage space, where he keeps all the ingredients he needs to prepare the dishes. The RAM is the restaurant's storage room, where all the ingredients for the entire restaurant are stored. The chef can get ingredients from the storage room, but it takes longer than getting them from his personal storage space.
As for the LLM (Large Language Model) size, it's a measure of the complexity of the model. The more parameters a model has, the more complex it is. 

The GPU needs to store these parameters in its memory (either VRAM or RAM) to process them. The larger the LLM size, the more memory the GPU needs. If the GPU doesn't have enough memory, it will have to keep fetching data from the slower RAM, which can slow down the processing.
So, in summary, the cores, VRAM, and RAM are all important components of a GPU. The cores do the processing, the VRAM stores data for quick access, and the RAM stores data for slower access. The LLM size determines how much memory the GPU needs to process the data.
